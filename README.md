# CS:GO Configuration

This is an updateable team config with support for personal settings.

## What's this?

The goal is to provide an easy and fast way to get a CS:GO team config file in place,
while still being able to tweak settings personally to have a more tailored experience.

Normally, you would configure your CS:GO game using the GUI.
The changes are then saved to the `config.cfg` file or `video.txt` and `videodefaults.txt`.

This repository provides two important files.
A `team.cfg`, which is the main configuration file for your team.
And an `autoexec.cfg`, which loads `team.cfg` before loading `personal.cfg`.
This approach enables you to use a shared team config with personal settings.

Simply add `autoexec.cfg` to your game start options, so that your `config.cfg` file is rewritten on CS:GO start.
Then adjust `personal.cfg` to your needs. You can Update your `team.cfg` by clicking `update.bat`.

## Features

- `autoexec.cfg` start option approach
- solid base configuration file for your team: `team.cfg`
- support for a `personal.cfg`
- `team.cfg` is updateable using cURL via `update.bat`
- `config.cfg` file is rewritten on CS:GO start

## Installation

1. Find your config folder

   You can find CS:GOs config folder under the path: `<STEAM>\userdata\<YOURID>\730\local\cfg`.
    - Where `<STEAM>` is the location of the STEAM folder on your disk, e.g. `C:\Steam`.
    - Where `<YOURID>` is the ID of your Steam account, e.g. `1234567`.

   For example: `C:\Steam\userdata\987654321\730\local\cfg`.

2. Download - https://github.com/jakoch/csgo-config/archive/master.zip
3. Extract `master.zip`, then move the content of the folder `csgo-config-master` into your config folder.
4. Create file `personal.cfg`. Add your personal setting to `personal.cfg`. See below for an example.
5. Set CS:GO Launch Options

   Go to `Steam > Library > Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (right-click) > Properties > Set Launch Options...`:

   Set: `-tickrate 128 -novid -console +exec autoexec.cfg`

6. Start CS:GO and your `config.cfg` is automatically created
   - From now on, you might pull changes to `team.cfg` by using `update.bat`

## How does this work?

1. `autoexec.cfg` is loaded, because of the csgo start option entry.
2. the individual config files are loaded by `autoexec.cfg`
   - firstly, the `team.cfg` is loaded. Giving you a solid base configuration.
   - secondly, the `personal.cfg` is loaded. Enabling you to overload any prior config values set with your personal settings.
5. finally, the `autoexec.cfg` runs `host_writeconfig` to write the new `config.cfg`.

That's it.

## How to update?

Simply run `update.bat` to update the `team.cfg` file.

It will use cURL to download the latest version of `team.cfg` from this Github repository.
